# Report on First Steps in Vagrant+VirtualBox
(host OS is macOS)

1. install Vagrant and VirtualBox
```
   brew install --cask vagrant

   brew install --cask virtualbox

   mkdir task_2_1
```
2. initialize vagrant
```
    vagrant init
```
```
    A `Vagrantfile` has been placed in this directory. You are now
    ready to `vagrant up` your first virtual environment! Please read
    the comments in the Vagrantfile as well as documentation on
    `vagrantup.com` for more information on using Vagrant.
```

3. configure VM
```
   vi Vagrantfile
```
```
    # -*- mode: ruby -*-
    # vi: set ft=ruby :

   Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
        config.vm.box = "ubuntu/focal64"
        config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080
        config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |v|
            v.memory = "1024"
            v.cpus = "2"
        end
   end 
```
   (configuration instructions from https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/docs) 

   (comments from Vagrantfile are also useful) 

   (guest os source is  https://vagrantcloud.com/ubuntu/focal64)

4. launch VM 
```
   vagrant up 
```
```

Vagrant is currently configured to create VirtualBox synced folders with
the `SharedFoldersEnableSymlinksCreate` option enabled. If the Vagrant
guest is not trusted, you may want to disable this option. For more
information on this option, please refer to the VirtualBox manual:

  https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html#sharedfolders

This option can be disabled globally with an environment variable:

  VAGRANT_DISABLE_VBOXSYMLINKCREATE=1

or on a per folder basis within the Vagrantfile:

  config.vm.synced_folder '/host/path', '/guest/path', SharedFoldersEnableSymlinksCreate: false

    default: The guest additions on this VM do not match the installed version of
    default: VirtualBox! In most cases this is fine, but in rare cases it can
    default: prevent things such as shared folders from working properly. If you see
    default: shared folder errors, please make sure the guest additions within the
    default: virtual machine match the version of VirtualBox you have installed on
    default: your host and reload your VM.
    default: 
    default: Guest Additions Version: 6.1.38
    default: VirtualBox Version: 7.0
==> default: Mounting shared folders...
    default: /vagrant => /.../itransition
```
5. connect to VM via SSH (add VM name if it is not 'default')
``` 
    vagrant ssh
```
```
