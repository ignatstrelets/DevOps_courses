# Report on Deployment of 2 VMs (web server + database) on localhost in Vagrant+VirtualBox
(host OS is macOS, deployed only two VMs due to storage limitations)

### 1. initialize vagrant
```
    vagrant init
```
```
    A `Vagrantfile` has been placed in this directory. You are now
    ready to `vagrant up` your first virtual environment! Please read
    the comments in the Vagrantfile as well as documentation on
    `vagrantup.com` for more information on using Vagrant.
```
### 2. add scripts for Nginx and SQLite installation on VMs


   (in this case we use Alpine Linux due to strict hardware limitations of our laptop,
   installation scripts included in repo in 'shell' directory)


### 3. configure VM


   (edit Vagrantfile, Vagrantfile included in repo)

### 4. launch instances in verbose mode with output to log file
```
    touch vagrant.log
    vagrant up --debug &> vagrant.log
```
  (vagrant.log included in repo)

### 5. connect to one of the instances
```
   vagrant ssh webserver
```
   (we have connected to an instance)
```
   nginx -V
```
```
   nginx version: nginx/1.14.2
   built with LibreSSL 2.7.5
   TLS SNI support enabled

```
```
   logout
```
```
   vagrant ssh database
```
   (we have connected to another instance)
```
   sqlite3 --version
```
```
   3.25.3 2018-11-05 20:37:38 89e099fbe5e13c33e683bef07361231ca525b88f7907be7092058007b750alt2
```
   (we should observe network configurations)
```
   ip a
```   
```

``` 
   (we should try 'ping' utility to test a connection between instances)
```
   ping -c 5 192.168.4.4 
```
```
   PING 192.168.4.4 (192.168.4.4): 56 data bytes
   64 bytes from 192.168.4.4: seq=0 ttl=42 time=0.955 ms

   64 bytes from 192.168.4.4: seq=4 ttl=42 time=1.126 ms
 
```
### 6. test NAT (port forwarding) on 'webserver' instance
   (reference for configuring Nginx: https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Nginx)

   (enter in local terminal)
```
   curl http://localhost:8888/
```
```
